<p>Hi {{ $user->name }},</p>

<p>Thank you for completing your application to work with CTM.</p>
<p>We are happy to tell you that you application has been approved and you are now ready to start booking shifts with us.</p>
<p>We will let you know when an event is open for booking so keep an eye on your emails, texts, and on our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We open events for booking roughly 6-8 weeks before the event starts. All you have to do is call the office to book your shifts.</p>
<p>We have a closed Facebook group which we would really like you to join – search CTM Official, request to join and we will accept you to the group – you will be able to find other CTM’ers, share your CTM photos, share lifts, hear about the events open for booking first!!</p>
<p>If you need any other information or have any questions about working with us, please get in touch and we will be happy to help.</p>
<p>The office number is 01676 549001 and office hours are 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with you!</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>The CTM Team.</p>
